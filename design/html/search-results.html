        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
          <li>3 cl Campari</li>
          <li>3 cl Red Vermouth</li>
          <li>A splash of Soda Water</li>

The cocktail was first served in creator Gaspare Campari's bar, Caffè Campari, in the 1860s. It was originally known as the "Milano-Torino" because of its ingredients: Campari, the bitter liqueur, is from Milan (Milano) and Punt e Mes, the vermouth, is from Turin (Torino). There is a popular belief that in the early 1900s, the Italians noticed a surge of Americans who enjoyed the cocktail. As a compliment to the Americans, the cocktail later became known as the "Americano". Another explanation is the name was derived from the Italian language word "amaro", which means "bitter".

        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
          <li>2 oz Gin</li>
          <li>3/4 oz Lemon juice</li>
          <li>3/4 oz Honey</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
Like many prohibition-era cocktails, the Bee's Knees was invented as a way to hide the scent and flavor of poor quality homemade spirits, in this case bathtub gin. The addition of honey was considered bizarre by some at the time, since sugar is more usual.[3] The honey sweetens the drink, and may make it palatable to people who don't normally like gin.

          <li>3 cl White rum</li>
          <li>3 cl Cognac</li>

The origin of the cocktail is usually credited to Harry MacElhone at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in the 1930s as a derivative of the sidecar. However, competing theories exist that claim the cocktail was created at The Berkeley in approximately 1921, or in French brothels as an apéritif for consumption by the prostitutes.

          <li>5 cl Vodka</li>
          <li>2 cl Coffee liqueur</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
This combination first appeared in 1949, and is ascribed to Gustave Tops, a Belgian barman, who created it at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels in honor of Perle Mesta, then U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg. The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a typical Russian spirit, and the blackness of the coffee liqueur.

        <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
          <li>6 cl Bourbon whiskey</li>
          <li>4 Mint leaves</li>
          <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
          <li>1 cl Water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
The mint julep was originally prescribed and appears in literature as early as 1784 "sickness at the stomach, with frequent retching, and, at times, a difficulty of swallowing. I then prescribed her an emetic, some opening powders, and a mint julep." An appearance of a mint julep in print came in a book by John Davis published in London in 1803, where it was described as "a dram of spirituous liquor that has mint steeped in it, taken by Virginians of a morning." However, Davis did not specify which spirit was used.
